## Reset.css

It was used to reset the web page, as it comes with default styles. For this purpose, the universal selector `*` was used, applying the rule to all elements of the page. This resets the spaces: Margin and Padding. The `box-sizing: border-box` configures the total size of an element (width and height) and includes borders and padding, making layout control easier.

## Style.css

The style choice for the page was inspired by a more retro theme for websites. The page is simple, but as part of my initial studies on the CSS styling language, I found it interesting to develop a menu bar, which I had not created before. Another point was adding a modal to open a brief explanation: "About" and "Functionality" of the project, implementing my first animation, which is the main content of the page, and also a footer with basic information. Everything is very simple, but the goal is to understand how native CSS can style an HTML file and how it interacts with programming languages and the logic involved in creating dynamic web pages. I am not using any frameworks yet; for now, I am focusing on understanding the fundamentals and how they should be applied along with best practices for web development.

## Responsive.css

It was used to provide responsiveness to the page for screens up to 600px. For this, the entire style structure was modified to adapt to screens of this size. I know that most accesses are made via mobile devices, but below 600px, I didn't find the page's behavior comfortable. Also, as I am still beginning my studies, there are optimizations that can be made, but I chose this screen size for now. I have not used any frameworks yet, only native CSS.
