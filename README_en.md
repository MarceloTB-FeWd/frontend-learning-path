# 🛠️ Frontend Learning Path 🧱

Welcome to my front-end projects repository! Here, you will find my first steps in web development, applying concepts I’ve learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I created this repository to develop, store, and better organize everything I’ve been practicing over time. This repository will include projects ranging from **newbie** to **junior** levels.

## About

This repository is a centralized hub for all the initial projects I developed during my web development learning journey. It was created to showcase my progress and growth as I explore the fundamentals of front-end development.

Each project represents a practical exercise aimed at applying and reinforcing concepts such as:

- **HTML**: Understanding how to structure a web page while focusing on implementing and following SEO best practices.  
- **CSS**: Learning how to style elements based on their characteristics in HTML and developing responsive designs suitable for various screen sizes.  
- **JavaScript**: Introducing basic interactivity and the foundations of programming logic.

These projects range from static pages to more interactive layouts, reflecting a gradual progression in complexity and skills (starting from zero).

## How to Run Locally

If you're starting **from scratch** like I am, feel free to download this repository locally. If you find a project or topic interesting at any point, you're welcome to replicate it and improve upon it.

Follow the steps below:

**1. Clone the repository:**

In the terminal (bash), type the following command:
```
   git clone https://github.com/marcelotb-fewd/frontend-learning-path.git
   ```

**2. Navigate to the desired project folder:**

In the terminal, type the following command:
```
cd/path-to-your-cloned-directory/Project_Name
```

**3. Open the file in your editor and look for:**
```
index.html
```
Each project folder contains its own `index.html` file at the root.

## Next Steps

- Continue studying and practicing basic concepts to eventually reach a junior level, where I may be able to:

- Add more projects that explore intermediate concepts of CSS and JavaScript;  
- Implement more advanced interactivity with JavaScript;  
- Explore libraries like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**, among others;  
- Add more complex projects as I progress in my learning journey.
