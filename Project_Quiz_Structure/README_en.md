## Project Name

Project - Quiz Structure

This project represents the continuation of studies focused on front-end web development and should be considered part of a 
long journey in web development.

This website was created using HTML5 and CSS3 as part of my learning in web development.
It is a structure with suggestions on where to place each component that makes up a quiz. Of course, this is not definitive, 
but rather an experimental process. It’s not meant to include everything required for a form, but rather to aid in understanding 
how each tag functions and how styling can be applied to them.

## Technologies Used

## Note

This project does not use any programming language to enable interaction between the user and the site when the form is submitted. 
In this case, it does not go anywhere, as there is no connection to a database or request to any API.
